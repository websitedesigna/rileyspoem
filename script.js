                content: `as darkness consumes us each and every one  
we feel distant and empty, nothing seems fun  
think back to childhood, playing in the sun  
with no worries or cares about this or that  
no feeling compares to the feeling of that  

the day, the moment, the second you feel down  
and the next thing you know, your mind shuts down  
feel drained and tired all the time  
looking everywhere for a better high  

those highs turn to lows and those lows subside  
but they always come running back into your life  
you don't see it yet, you won't, you can't  
but you know it's there, growing like a plant  

a plant that's dying slowly, no water or sun  
no joy  
no fun  
a weight on your shoulders feels like a ton  
can't face the problems, so you just run  

run faster and further just to escape  
doing anything at all to relive those days  
feel like you fall, you have nothing to say  
speechless mouth, mind racing fast  
hoping this feeling won't last  

hoping it will go — fuck the past  
fuck the past  
fuck the past  

think of future, brighter days  
'think of good stuff' is what they say  
so in my bed, on my phone I lay  
writing this with nothing but pain  

a void of darkness never to end  
an enemy — pure evil, but your best friend  
drugs and drinks soothe the pain  
till you sober up and feel it again  

you feel nothing but hurt, pain so great  
so great it ends you, puts you in this place  
this place with no hope, no light  
not a helping hand or mate in sight  

just you and your demons — you know you can't fight  
the walls in your mind start to close in tight  
and the demons and worries, they start to bite  
you can see the pain in my eyes  
or is it just 'cause I'm high?  

feed off your ego and pain that you keep  
you've tried and tried, but you can't release  
the pain, the hurt, the locked up peace  
you see a door and it looks like a way out  
then you realise it's not, so you scream and shout  

resort to anger and pain on others  
because you couldn't feel that love from your mother  
it's bad you couldn't see her making you dinner  
I'm glad she couldn't see me turn to a sinner  

am I mad at her? I'm not sure  
the times she left me crying on the floor  
the times she made me feel like shit  
the times she made me throw a fit  

the times I was young and couldn't understand  
that she was drunk and drugged, yet she still held my hand  
she promised me she loved me, but was she even sober  
she promised she'd change, but was never closer  

so I learnt to survive with a heart growing colder  
now I look in the mirror and see her over my shoulder  
a pain in my heart, heavy like a boulder  
and I still stand here like a fallen soldier  

heart broke and woeful, like the pain she once felt  
then I realise what I'm saying and my heart begins to melt  
I see why now she did all of this shit  
she was just like me — and that was it  

my brain, it clicked, I thought all wrong  
my mum is me and I'm her all along  
a shit childhood turns to drinks and drugs  
turns to hanging around with dickheads and thugs  

my life isn't bad and could be worse  
but it's still a pain that greatly hurts  
cuts deep at the core like a blade so sharp  
just open the door, let me out of this dark  

my mind now empty and free again  
but give it an hour — fuck that, give it ten

                content: `this is nothing but real  
nothing but hurt  
understand how I feel  
just to kick me in the dirt  
nothing but facts that I spit on this page  
nothing but anger filled with rage  
embarrassment, but I turned it to greatness  
hoping one day I'll be famous  
hoping one day I can help my dad  
'cause he always there, the only real person I had  
my dad, my dad, I love him so much  
would lend me money even when times were tough  
he's proper funny, I don't see him enough  
such a great guy, and I see that now  
I'll love him till I die and that's facts from my mouth  

my mum though, she wasn't really there  
a mum but not a mother, she'd zone out and stare  
she loved drugs and clubs and roadmen and thugs  
all this shit, but not her son  
and I know it hurt her, but it hurt me more  
she'd make me sleep on the kitchen floor  
I mean I knew she loved me, but why'd she love drugs more  
and that's a hole in my heart that will never fill  
a hole so empty it doesn't feel real  
but it scarred over time, now my heart's made of steel  

don't give a fuck about no one and that shit's too real  
I'll show you respect and I'll be polite  
I'll give you myself, but when you bark I bite  
that's when it stops in the middle of the night  
eyes are dry and feelings are too  
you're sat by yourself, which is nothing new  
but this time you realise it is just you  

just you and yourself  
your shitty mental health  
your life and past  
that changed so fast  
your heart in parts  
'cause you wanted it to last  
but nothing's forever  
not you, not me  
as light as a feather  
till you realise you're weak  

then you start getting shit  
from people you cared for  
but did they care for you  
they talk behind your back and be so rude  
and then look you in your eyes and say I care about you  
no you don't, you never did  
but I did, and now I feel like shit  
feel like a knob 'cause you trusted that guy  
feel so wrong 'cause it felt so right  

but it's calm, you know everything's alright  
and here you are again in the middle of the night  
where's the light, let me switch it back  
look in the mirror and your face starts to crack  
your eyes grow fluid  
and your smile begins to fade  
and you sit opposite this mirror feeling brave  

say fuck everyone, they don't matter no more  
it's me, myself, and all of my thoughts  
'cause that can take me places that those pricks can't  
and that's why I sit here with no one in my arms  
but fuck being a bitch  
gotta harden up a bit  
'cause your life is shit  
but it's not worth a fit  
it's not worth death or any more than a sigh  
feel alone in the darkness of the night  

by yourself from the start to the end  
got people to help and make you feel alright again 
but your gonna have shit come your way
the shit that turned you to what you are today  
and what you are today  
is something great

it means you're alive, and you made it through  
all that wreckage couldn’t shatter you  
the clouds rolled back, and i saw the blue  
not in the sky — it was inside too  

now i walk slow, breathe with care  
listen to silence and just be there  
not running, not hiding, not chasing highs  
just watching calm in the open skies 
i still feel storms, they come and go
but now i know they won’t steal my glow
i can stand tall, even when it’s rough
i can face the thunder, i can face the tough
i can sit with the rain, let it wash away
i can feel the pain, but i’ll be okay
i can find peace in the darkest night
i can hold on tight, and i’ll be alright
i can see the beauty in the mess i made 

life ain’t perfect but it’s soft today  
and that’s enough — i’ll be okay`

a place you land when you're kicked out the door  
not for grades or gold stars or praise  
but 'cause your life took a darker phase  

people say it's full of bad kids and thugs  
kids that sell bits or live off drugs  
but walk through the gates and look again  
you’ll see broken hearts trying to mend  

see lads with anger, girls who fight  
kids that can't sleep through the night  
not bad people — just misunderstood  
trying to do better, if only they could  

teachers that listen, not just shout  
they ask how you feel — not what you're about  
they've seen the worst, they've seen the tears  
they still show up, year after year  

you walk in with rage built deep in your chest  
but you walk out thinking maybe I can rest  
a smile from staff, just one small chat  
can change how you feel — and that's a fact  

you learn more here than English or math  
you learn who you are, and how not to crash  
you learn how to talk, how to breathe, how to cope  
you learn there's still something called hope  

'cause they don't see you as a problem to solve  
they see a life that's trying to evolve  
a kid with pain, but still with light  
a kid who's learning how to fight right  

I used to hate school, I really did  
I felt like a failure, a dumb little kid  
but here I feel like someone sees me  
not what I've done — but what I can be  

it's still tough, don't get me wrong  
some days feel heavy, some nights too long  
but I've got a chance now, a place to belong  
and for once in my life — I don't feel wrong`

what happened to when everyone was so nice  
what happened to the times where guilt was not there  
what happened to the times when we swore we wouldn't swear  
what happened to the times where we promised never to smoke  
what happened to the times where we were full of hope  
what happened to the times where we had the sun in our face  
what happened to the times where everything wasn't a race  

took our time nice and slow  
wished every winter we would see snow  
now we wish that our sadness would go  
now we wish for one more line of coke  
now we wish we weren't all evil inside  
now we wish for a better life  

a past that struck like thunder, no light  
a past that cut deeper like a knife  
a past that we wish we could escape and heal  
a past where nothing seemed real  
a past, a past, but what about future  
our hearts in casts 'cause we never had a tutor  
no one to teach us right from wrong  
independent and lonely all in one song  

but now we escape, just light up a bong  
then you feel alright and nothing's wrong  
a good high where your mind seems found  
but really it's lost, and then you've hit the ground  

you realise it's not all about you  
you realise you're not big or bad or rude  
you're just a little boy who's so confused  
a little boy who couldn't handle the truth  

the thing most fucked in this world today  
is how many people that choose to escape  
it's how many people that feel the same way  
they can't live sober, so they throw that life away  

the thing we don't have enough of is altered perspective  
'cause think if you weren't respected  
think if seeing a mother wasn't expected  
abandoned, then found — found but still neglected  

a difference in these words that I lay upon you now  
the fact that people just can't see or understand how  
others may feel when you run your mouth  
others feel like shit 24/7  
they don't need your shit 'cause then they're one step closer to heaven  

suicide is a permanent fixture  
but can people really see what's in that mixture  
there's family, friends, loved ones too  
all of this, yet nothing's new  

you feel down, empty, nothing to give  
you take and take, but it's not your gift  
then you break and you're broke, don't see why you should live  
broken inside is a pain  
so deep it's hard to explain  
so real it hurts, nothing to gain  

you feel entrapped in your own game  
then you realise we're all the same  
all been through stuff we can't regain  
all been through shit again and again  
all been hurt deep and saddened  

so let me ask you again — what really happened?`

called out for help but no one chimed in  
thought about endings, real dark roads  
carried my pain like it was code  

some days i laid there, didn’t rise  
stared at ceilings with bloodshot eyes  
shook in my skin, doubted my worth  
asked god why he put me on earth  

but time... it teaches, it doesn’t shout  
and pain don’t leave, it just rounds out  
now i wear it like armour, soft but tight  
a history written in scars and fight  

i’ve lost people, some still alive  
seen love turn cold, watched it die  
held hands that swore they’d stay  
only to vanish by the next day  

but i forgave them, had to for me  
you can’t heal when your soul ain’t free  
anger is poison, revenge a chain  
and i got tired of carrying pain  

i started walking slower, looked around  
saw flowers still grow from broken ground  
heard laughter in places pain once lived  
saw my own heart start to forgive  

it’s not perfect — healing’s slow  
some days hurt, but i let them go  
some nights feel like the old ones back  
but i breathe and wait for the light to crack  

i’m not fixed, and i’m not whole  
but i’m stitched together, soul by soul  
and i’ll keep walking, even if it’s slight  
from the ashes i rise — into the light`

just a hollow shell where i used to be  
eyes glazed over like a frozen sea  
memories buried where no one can see  

they told me i’d grow, told me i’d heal  
but never explained how numb would feel  
how pain can hide behind every meal  
how silence cuts sharper than steel  

i laugh but it don’t reach my soul  
like filling a cup with a bottomless hole  
chasing love just to feel whole  
but every kiss just takes its toll  

they say “be yourself” — but who is that?  
the kid they hurt or the one who fights back?  
the quiet one curled up in his flat  
or the loud one faking like he’s all that  

every version of me screams out loud  
but gets drowned in the noise of the crowd  
a smile so big but i'm not proud  
'cause no one sees the storm in the cloud  

too scared to sleep, too dead to wake  
every breath feels like a mistake  
all these truths i fake and fake  
waiting for something real to break  

i try to be kind, to show some grace  
but i’m always at war with my own face  
never learned how to feel safe  
just learned to run, learned to erase  

erase the boy who used to dream  
replace him with a haunted scream  
erase the light, embrace the night  
'cause the dark don’t ask if you’re alright`

smile wide while i’m dead inside  
can’t cry no more, the tears ran dry  
now i just sit and wonder why  

why this weight stays on my chest  
why my heart won’t let me rest  
why even when i try my best  
i still feel like such a mess  

wake up, light a smoke, and scroll  
mind on mute, no self-control  
all these thoughts take their toll  
eating away what once was whole  

i drink, i sink, i think too much  
hands shake from things i never touch  
memories hit like a violent punch  
some days i can't even eat lunch  

i fake joy, fake peace, fake strength  
wear masks that stretch at every length  
but deep inside i feel so tense  
like life’s just pain behind a fence  

people say "you’ll heal, it’ll pass"  
but time moves slow, and pain moves fast  
every minute feels like the last  
stuck in a loop that’s tied to my past  

i miss the days of being free  
before i lost the younger me  
before this pain became my plea  
before this world stopped hearing me`

then turns to a thought like “what if i die?”  
not in a note or a tragic goodbye  
just vanish quietly, no need to cry  

one drink becomes five, and now im gone  
drifting in places i dont belong  
around fake love and plastic songs  
in a world that feels so wrong  

numb is normal, peace feels fake  
every smile is a risk i take  
every hug just makes me ache  
like giving and getting for no ones sake  

they told me “be strong,” so i play the part  
while silence keeps tearing my world apart  
no outlet for this aching heart  
so i drown in pain like its modern art  

i see my dad when i punch the wall  
see my mum in the way i fall  
see my youth in a bottle small  
and i hate that i still feel it all  

cycle repeats, i try to change  
but pain just shifts and re-arranges  
same me, just different stages  
locked in this fight for ages and ages  

but still i rise, still i stand  
still wipe the blood off of my hands  
still scream into the empty land  
hoping one day theyll understand`
